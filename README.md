# SlothuBot
Slothu is a Discord Bot written in C# using the .NET Core (v2.0) Framework, utilising the Discord.NET (v2.0.1) API wrapper.

This current version of the bot is currently in the development process and thus has 0 features as of yet, to see a working version with features, please see the original SlothuBot repository. This version will eventually replace the original.

The reason behind this version of the bot is to rewrite the original code to be more readable and elegant. The original code was not at all planned out and was a complete mess, this version aims to fix these problems.
